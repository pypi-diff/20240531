 The purpose of this project is to provide a python-based alternative to JSON. This is a (almost) fully functional JSON-inspired data management system!
 
 ## How to Use ##
 This is a pip package, so to use this in python you can just `pip install pyson-data`.
 From there, you can just `import pyson_data as pyson`.

 Documentation has also been moved to the project wiki [here](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON/wiki) to decrease clutter in the README.
 
 ## Supported Types ##
 There are 4 supported types: int, float, str, and list
 <br><br>
-- An int is a whole number that can be any valu
-- A str is a list of text (quotes not required)
-- A list is a list of values, which currently have to all be strings. List items are seperated by the (*) seperator.
-Currently there is no escaping support. I don't really know why you would use that value normally in a list.
